The nature of the relationship between User and Product depends on the business logic and requirements of your application. Below are two possible scenarios:

One-to-Many Relationship (1:N):

Scenario: A user can have multiple products, but each product is associated with only one user.
Reasoning:
This relationship makes sense if, for example, users can create or own multiple products, but each product is uniquely tied to a single user.
An e-commerce platform could be an example where each user can have a list of products they own or have purchased.
Many-to-Many Relationship (N:N):

Scenario: A user can be associated with multiple products, and a product can be associated with multiple users.
Reasoning:
This relationship is appropriate when multiple users can have shared ownership or access to the same products.
For instance, in a collaborative project management tool, multiple users might be assigned to or collaborate on the same set of products.
Ultimately, the choice between a one-to-many and a many-to-many relationship depends on the specific use case and business requirements of your application.
